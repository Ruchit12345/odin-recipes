    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dal rice is a simple, comforting dish that holds a special place in everyday meals across
        South Asia. Made by cooking lentils until soft and lightly spiced, then serving them over steamed 
        rice, it’s nourishing, filling, and easy on the stomach. The dal can vary from yellow moong or toor to
        masoor, each bringing its own texture and flavor, while the rice provides a neutral, fluffy base that 
        balances the spices perfectly.</p>
    <p>What makes dal rice so loved is its warmth and versatility. It can be kept plain for a soothing, home-style meal or 
        elevated with ghee, cumin tempering, pickles, or a squeeze of lemon. Whether eaten during a busy weekday lunch or 
        as comfort food on a quiet evening, dal rice represents simplicity, nourishment, and the taste of home.</p>
